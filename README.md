# mgmt467-analytics-portfolio
This is a repository to display my work for MGMT 467: AI-Assisted Big Data Analytics in the Cloud. This repository holds files for labs, assignments, and final project. The subjects of the labs differ from AI-assisted analytics to BigQuery machine learning to data engineering. The assignments are team projects that consist of research notebooks, executive briefs, visualizations, and documentation. Our final project will consist of building and presenting an end-to-end data analytics pipeline that solves a real-world business problem.
